        <strong>Welcome to the Curtin University Assistive Technology Research Group Image Database.</strong> The image databases are becoming an important element of the emerging information technologies. They have been used in a wide variety of applications such as geographical information systems, computer-aided design and manufacturing systems, multimedia libraries, and medical image management systems. This image database is consists with synchronized inertial measurement unit (IMU) data and Meta Information of the images. As images are taken under the different environmental and physical conditions like low lighting and shadow conditions and blurring, an image database is necessary to be created with meta data of the images and the IMU data which are collected during the image capturing process, in order to investigate image enhancement mechanisms.  </div>

            <p>A “standardized” image databases is an important tool in the comparative assessment of image processing techniques in the field of indoor and outdoor navigation. Databases of these types have been used in a wide variety of applications such as geographical information systems (GIS), computer-aided design and manufacturing systems (CAD/CAM), multimedia libraries, and medical image management systems.
The primary objective of this effort is to build a comprehensive image database with a variety of image collectioned with the inertial measurement unit (IMU) data and meta data captured and synchronized over the image exposure time</p>

      One of the other aspects of this database is to provide a publically available data set for image enhancements and de-blurring as well as it can be used by anyone who needs testing and training of object tracking, path detection algorithms in different conditions .Specially the research group examining “Way Finding for People with Vision Impairments” at Curtin University. The most significant use of IMU data in the image capture is de-blurring and other image enhancements
<br /><br />

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"> An additional set of images will be populated by applying existing techniques for image enhancements, edge detections and de-blurring. This image set can be used as a base reference for new image processing algorithms being developed.</div>
To capture the images for experimental purposes, the capture device is mounted on a tripod at chest height which is the most suitable placement in human gait while the subject is performing different activities such as walking on sidewalks and stairways. The stability of capturing device and how its positions relatively to the ground level throughout the activity and all other IMU data are the key to measure, in order to determine the optimal position. When capturing the images, the walking speed of user and oriented angles may affect image quality resulting blurred images.
